# opencv_helper

This is a flutter plugin for opencv. However, the OpenCV library contains too many things, I'm not intend to build a plugin which supports lots of them, and this plugin is mainly for some specific scenarios in another project [Okapia](https://github.com/drriguz/ben/tree/master/okapia). Here are some ideas behind creating this plugin:

* Both android/ios must be supported(that's the biggest benefit of flutter, right?)
* Provide a scaffold for users to build whatever they wanted by using OpenCV, thus it's better to use it in a native c++ way

## Getting Started

* TBD
